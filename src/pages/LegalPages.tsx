        <p>
          {appConfig.name} (“we”, “us”) is operated by {operator()}, based in <Val v={legalConfig.country} label="country" />. This policy explains what information the {appConfig.name}{' '}

          <strong>Account.</strong> Your username and password. Passwords are stored only as a secure one-way hash by our authentication provider; we can’t see them. If you add one,
          your optional recovery email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your content.</strong> Trackers, time slots, tasks (titles, optional descriptions, categories), task completion history, focus sessions (task name, length, date),
          friend connections, and settings such as theme, week start and time format.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subscriptions.</strong> If you buy Pro: your plan, its status and dates, and the payment provider’s subscription reference. We never receive or store card, UPI or bank
          details.

        <p>
          <strong>Technical information.</strong> Our hosting and database providers process IP addresses and basic request logs to deliver and secure the service.

        <ul>
          <li>To provide the service: save your timetable, show your progress, sync between devices.</li>
          <li>To secure your account: log in, password recovery (only if you added a recovery email), rate-limiting abuse.</li>
          <li>To provide the paid-plan features you bought and enforce plan limits.</li>

          Your tasks are private. Accepted friends can see only daily totals — completion percentage, number of tasks completed and focus minutes — and only while “Share my progress
          with friends” is on in Settings. Leaderboards are off unless you opt in. Friends never see task names, descriptions, your timetable, your email or your subscription.

          We keep your account and content until you delete them or your account. Deleting a tracker, task or session removes it immediately. Deleting your account removes your
          profile, trackers, tasks, history, focus sessions, friend connections and recovery email. Short-lived security records (such as rate-limit counters) are deleted within a
          day. Provider backups and logs may take a limited time to expire. Payment providers keep transaction records as the law requires.

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          Data is sent over encrypted connections (HTTPS). Every table is protected by database access rules so one user can’t read another’s data. Passwords are hashed, password
          reset links are single-use and expire, and sensitive actions require your current password. No system is perfectly secure, so please use a strong, unique password.

        <p>
          These Terms govern your use of the {appConfig.name} website and apps, operated by {operator()}. By creating an account or using {appConfig.name}, you agree to these Terms
          and to our{' '}

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>
          You need a username and password. You must be at least {legalConfig.minimumAge} years old (or the minimum age required where you live) and provide accurate information.
          One person may create more than one account, but accounts are personal and may not be sold or transferred.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Account Security</h2>
        <p>
          Keep your password secret and use a strong, unique one. You’re responsible for activity on your account. Without a confirmed recovery email we cannot reset a forgotten
          password. Tell us promptly at {contact()} if you suspect unauthorised use.

        <ul>
          <li>Don’t break the law, harass other users, or use offensive usernames.</li>
          <li>Don’t try to access other people’s data, bypass plan limits or security, or disrupt the service (including automated scraping or excessive requests).</li>

        <p>
          You own what you put into {appConfig.name} (tasks, notes, names). You give us permission to store and process it only to provide the service to you — for example to show
          it to you, and to show the totals you choose to share with friends. You’re responsible for your content.

        <h2>6. Free and Paid Plans</h2>
        <p>
          The free plan is free of charge and has limits shown on the Pricing page. Plus and Pro are optional paid subscriptions with additional features, and prices may differ by region. We may change features and limits
          over time; if a limit is reduced we won’t delete content you already created.

        <h2>7. Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Pro renews automatically at the end of each billing period (monthly or yearly) until cancelled. The price and billing period are shown before you pay. Free trials, when
          offered, are limited to one per account and end automatically without charge unless you subscribe.

        <h2>8. Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Payments are processed by third-party payment providers (on the website) or Google Play (in the Android app), under their terms. Prices may include or exclude taxes as
          shown at checkout. If a renewal payment fails, paid features may stop until payment succeeds.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>9. Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          You can cancel at any time from the Pricing page (website) or Google Play (Android). Cancelling stops future renewals; Pro remains active until the end of the paid period.
          Your data stays in your account after Pro ends.

        <h2>10. Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          <Val v="" label="refund policy — decide and describe it here" /> Purchases made through Google Play are subject to Google Play’s refund policies. Nothing in these Terms
          limits refund rights you have under the law where you live.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>11. Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          The free plan may show a limited number of ads on some pages, only with your consent where required. Paying members (Plus and Pro) don’t see ads. We are not responsible for the content of
          third-party ads.

        <h2>12. Third-party Services</h2>
        <p>
          {appConfig.name} relies on third-party providers (listed in the Privacy Policy). Their services are governed by their own terms, and we are not responsible for their
          availability.

        <h2>13. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>
          We work to keep {appConfig.name} available and your data safe, but the service is provided “as is” and may occasionally be unavailable for maintenance or reasons outside
          our control. Please keep your own exports of important data.
        </p>

        <p>
          The {appConfig.name} software, name, logo and design belong to {operator()} and are protected by law. These Terms don’t give you any rights to them other than to use the
          service.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>15. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You can delete your account at any time in Settings. We may suspend or close accounts that seriously or repeatedly break these Terms, or where required by law. Where
          reasonable we’ll give notice and the chance to export your data first.

        <h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, {operator()} is not liable for indirect or consequential losses, or for loss of data, arising from your use of the service. Our total
          liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim. Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that can’t be excluded by law.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>18. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms. We’ll change the effective date and, for significant changes, tell you in the app. Continuing to use the service means you accept the new Terms.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>19. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of <Val v={legalConfig.country} label="country/jurisdiction" />, without affecting mandatory consumer protections where you live.
