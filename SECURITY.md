# Security

How HabitFlow protects accounts and data, what was tested, and known limitations.

## Architecture

| Layer | Holds | Talks to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser / Android app | public Supabase key, the user’s session | Supabase (RLS-protected), Edge Functions |
| Postgres (RLS) | all app data, plans, subscriptions | — |
| Edge Functions | secrets: service role, Resend, Anthropic, Razorpay, Google Play | Supabase admin API, providers |

Nothing secret is in the website bundle: `VITE_*` values are public identifiers only.

## Authentication

- Username + password via Supabase Auth; passwords are bcrypt-hashed by Supabase and
  never stored or logged by the app. Logins use `username@habitflow.local` internally.
- Sensitive actions require the **current password**, checked server-side by
  `check_password()` (bcrypt compare). 5 wrong attempts in 15 minutes locks the check.
  Wrong-password paths return a result instead of raising, so attempts are counted.
- Changing username keeps the same user id; the login address is updated in
  `auth.users` and `auth.identities` in one transaction.

## Password recovery

- Only available if the account has a **confirmed** recovery email.
- The `password-reset` function uses Supabase Auth’s own recovery token
  (`generateLink`): securely generated, **single-use, expires in 1 hour**, verified by
  Supabase. The email links to `/reset-password?token_hash=…`; the app verifies it with
  `verifyOtp`, removes it from the address bar immediately, lets the user set a new
  password, then signs out all sessions.
- Responses are identical whether or not an account matched, and sending happens in the
  background so timing doesn’t reveal accounts. Rate limits: 10/hour per IP, 3/hour per
  identifier.
- No passwords in URLs or emails; no custom reset tokens.

## Recovery email verification

- Adding/changing requires the current password (stops a stolen session from
  redirecting recovery).
- A 32-byte random token is emailed; only its SHA-256 hash is stored; it expires after
  24 h and works once. A verified address stays active until the new one is confirmed,
  and the old address is notified of the change.
- Removing requires the password and shows a warning.

## Authorization (RLS)

- Every table has RLS. Users can read/write only their own rows; composite foreign keys
  prevent attaching rows to another user’s tracker/task.
- `subscriptions`, `plans`, `account_private`, `rate_events` have **no** write access for
  users. Internal helpers (`plan_of`, `has_feature`, `plan_limit`, `are_friends`,
  `hit_rate_limit`) are not executable by users.
- Friends see only daily totals, only while `share_progress` is on; leaderboards are
  opt-in (default off). No task titles, descriptions, timetables, emails ever leave
  their owner through these functions.

## Subscriptions & payments

- Pro status comes only from `subscriptions`, written only by server code after
  verification. There is no `isPro` flag a client can set; the UI reads
  `my_entitlements()` and the database enforces limits independently.
- **Razorpay:** subscriptions are created server-side with the user id in notes; the
  checkout callback’s HMAC signature is verified and the real status is then fetched
  from Razorpay. Webhooks require a valid HMAC-SHA256 signature (constant-time compare).
- **Google Play:** purchase tokens are verified with the Play Developer API using a
  service account; the purchase must carry the user’s id as `obfuscatedAccountId`.
- No fake success paths exist; payment UI is hidden when a provider isn’t configured.

## Exports

CSV and PDF are built from `export_timetable()`, which returns only the caller’s rows and
only for accounts with the feature. Files are generated in the browser and never stored
on a server, so there is no shared URL another user could fetch. CSV cells are protected
against spreadsheet formula injection.

## AI, analytics, errors, ads

- **AI:** API key only on the server; per-user rate limits; the model receives the
  question, recent conversation, page path and plan name — no tasks, emails, passwords,
  tokens or payment data. If the service fails, the app answers from local help articles.
- **Analytics:** allow-listed event names and properties; paths only (no query strings or
  fragments, UUIDs replaced); loaded only after consent.
- **Sentry:** loaded only with a DSN; user info, cookies, headers, bodies and query strings
  disabled; tokens/emails/passwords scrubbed from messages and breadcrumbs.
- **Ads:** only with advertising consent, never for Pro, never on timer/check-offs/account
  flows/errors, no placeholders.

## Tested

`tests/launch-security.test.mjs` and `tests/api-security.test.mjs` run against the real
project and check, among others:

- User A cannot read or modify User B’s trackers, tasks, completions, sessions, profile,
  subscriptions or exports; anonymous users get nothing.
- A free user cannot bypass limits by skipping the UI (direct inserts are refused by the
  database), cannot insert/update subscriptions (`isPro=true`), cannot call internal
  plan functions, cannot set Pro themes, export or use leaderboards.
- Forged Razorpay webhooks are rejected and do not grant Pro; billing needs a valid login.
- Password-protected actions reject wrong passwords; lockout after 5 attempts.
- Username change keeps trackers, friends and plan; old username stops working.
- Recovery tokens: invalid, expired and reused tokens are rejected.
- Friend comparison respects sharing; leaderboard only includes opted-in friends and no
  task names; non-friends can’t compare.
- Account deletion requires the password and removes all data.

## Known limitations / to do

- Supabase “secure password change” (re-authentication email) is not used because users
  have no login mailbox; the app verifies the current password itself instead.
- Focus sounds are gated in the UI only (they are generated in the browser; nothing to
  protect server-side).
- The 30-day free view of *your own* statistics is a presentation limit: your raw data is
  yours and needed by the timetable. Server-side history limits apply to comparisons and
  exports.
- Enable Supabase’s leaked-password protection and CAPTCHA on sign-up (Auth settings)
  before a public launch to slow automated sign-ups.
- Google Play verification is implemented but can only be tested once a Play Console
  product exists. Razorpay checkout/webhooks are implemented but untested until you add
  Razorpay test keys (the webhook re-fetches the subscription from Razorpay, so replayed
  or out-of-order events can’t roll a status back).
- The per-IP limit on password-reset requests uses the first `x-forwarded-for` address;
  the per-username/email limit (3/hour) is the one that protects inboxes.
- Username lookups (friend requests) can reveal whether a username exists — inherent to
  adding friends by username.
